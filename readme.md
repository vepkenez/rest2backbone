Intro
=====

This project aims to made easier to develop django application with REST API and rich clients, that are using this API via **[backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org)**.  In django it uses **[djangorestframework](http://django-rest-framework.org)**  to quickly define RESTful API.

Key features:
-------------
- Generates models and collection definitions in JS from resources and models definitions in django.
- Backbone Models should contain (as per models/resources definitions in Django):
 * default values
 * validations
 * support to load values from HTML form
- Collections:
 * support paging and searches and ordering
 * special 'index' collections - just ID and representation of object - can be used in dynamic selects, autocompletes etc.

- Can generate forms templates (based on models and resources definitions) for use in pages
  (also read only forms)
- Forms can:
 * update validation result to form
 * save modified form to server (via rest API - using Backbone models and colections).
- A sample application - showing how it should be used.


Quick Start
===========

Setup virtual environment and install dependencies
`virtualenv venv
`. venv/bin/activate  # assuming you're running linux or MacOS. In case of Windows, run venv/bin/activate.bat
`pip -r requirements.pip`

Load sample data
`./manage.py loaddata sample_app/fixtures/sample_data.json`

Run server
`./manage.py runserver`

In browser open http://localhost:8000/

In browser (Firefox/Chrome) open developer tools - to see API requests to server - on load/change of models

Look into `sample_app` directory to see how to use.
